## Project Overview
The Site Survey Tool is a full-stack web application designed to help Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
plan, document, and manage network installations across large physical locations such as:

- Apartment complexes (MDUs)
- Office buildings (MTUs)
- University and government campuses
- Public and commercial areas

The application allows field engineers to perform structured site surveys before deployment,
reducing installation errors, cost, and rework.
