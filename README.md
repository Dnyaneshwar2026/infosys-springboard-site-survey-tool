## Project Overview
The Site Survey Tool is a software application designed to assist Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
in planning and managing network installations across large areas such as apartment complexes,
office buildings, campuses, and public spaces.

The tool enables engineers to collect, manage, and analyze critical site-related information
before actual network deployment, helping reduce installation cost, time, and errors.
